# Day 8 – Password Strength Checker (Python)

This project is part of my Python Beginner Projects series.  
In this project, the program checks the strength of a password entered by the user.

- Length ≥ 8 characters  
- At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)  
- At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)  
- At least 1 digit (0-9)  
- At least 1 special character (`!@#$%^&*()` etc.)

- Loops (`for`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
