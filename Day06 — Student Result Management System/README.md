# Day 6 – Student Result Management System (Python)

This project is part of my Python learning journey.  
In Day 6, I built a simple **Student Result Management System** using Python.

The program takes a student's name and marks for multiple subjects, then calculates:

- Average marks  
- Grade based on average  
- Pass or Fail status based on subject-wise marks

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Boolean logic
- User input & formatted output

---

## 📚 Subjects Included

- Bangla  
- English  
- Math  
- Science

## 🧮 Grading System

| Average Marks | Grade |
|--------------|-------|
| 80+ | A+ |
| 70 – 79 | A |
| 60 – 69 | A- |
| 50 – 59 | B+ |
| 40 – 49 | C |
| 33 – 39 | D |
| Below 33 | Fail |

---

## ✅ Pass / Fail Rule

- A student **passes** only if all subject marks are **33 or above**
- If any subject mark is below 33, the student **fails**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   main.py
